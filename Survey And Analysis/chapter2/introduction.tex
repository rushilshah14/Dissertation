Digitalising the Extenuating Circumstances Forms would have different platforms to choose from. Technology has advanced to different levels. Web based Systems, Smart Phone Applications, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence\cite{forbestop7} and recently introduced Blockchain Technology. However, for a system allowing users to fill forms it would be difficult to use Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality as these are used for altering the perception of the world\cite{arvr}. Same goes for Artificial Intelligence as this would be costly to implement and not very useful when it comes to Extenuating Circumstances. In this section we will look at Web Based Systems, Mobile Phone Applications and the Blockchain Technology!
