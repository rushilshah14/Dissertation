\textbf{{\large Background}} \\[2mm]

Students who suffer from personal problems usually fill out the Extenuating Circumstances Form (ECF) which are then processed by various departments, some with higher clearance than others. This project is based on creating a system which can achieve confidentiality, ease of access and increase efficiency by reducing paperwork. Data has to remain confidential not only with different levels of hierarchy but also from outsiders trying to gain access.  \\[4mm]

\textbf{{\large Project Aims}} \\[2mm]

The system should make it easy for the students as well as the scrutiny committee to process extenuating circumstances efficiently and reduce the confusion that occurs when papers are involved. Confidentiality, ease of access and efficient data processing has to be achieved from this project. \\[4mm]


\textbf{{\large Achievements to date}} \\[2mm]

Research based on different types of potential systems has been completed with Django a web based system having the greatest ability for this project compared to Mobile phone applications or Artificial Intelligence or Augmented/Virtual Reality. Different web based programming languages were also accounted for and Django fit perfectly. \\[4mm]
