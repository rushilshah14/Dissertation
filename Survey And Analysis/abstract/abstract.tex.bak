\textbf{{\large Background}} \\[2mm]

Students who suffer from personal problems usually fill out the Extenuating Circumstances Form (ECF) which are then processed by various departments, some with higher clearance than others. This project is based on creating a system which can achieve confidentiality, ease of access and increase efficiency by reducing paperwork. Data has to remain confidential not only with different levels of hierarchy but also from outsiders trying to gain access.  \\[4mm]

\textbf{{\large Project Aims}} \\[2mm]

The system should achieve confidentiality, allow the stakeholders to toggle around quickly and efficiently allowing feedback and communication at all times and should reduce the paperwork pile. \\[4mm]


\textbf{{\large Achievements to date}} \\[2mm]

Comparison between potential systems; Web based system or a mobile phone application. Information processing with a lot of data would not be readily accessible on an application and so a web based system is a potential project.\\[4mm]
