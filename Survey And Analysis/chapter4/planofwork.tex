From this point forward i plan on learning how to use Django as a programming language and build a simple website for starters which i can then build on to make it a better and secure web system for this project. Following the interface plan is a key and making sure the project does not go off requirements with the help of testing with users as well as unit tests. Testing will be performed side by side with the development as well as at the end to make sure the project does not go off path. Figure~\ref{fig:ganttchart} shows the plan of work from this date onwards.
