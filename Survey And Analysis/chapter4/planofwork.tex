Being able to have all research in hand i now plan to start working on the Django web portal prototype. This will require learing of Django and building a website from scratch. Running tests is an important task and will be completed along with the building of the prototype. This way any issues with the testing can be handled right away as the coding is still in progress. 
Figure~\ref{fig:ganttchart} shows the a Gantt Chart with the progress based on the development of this project.
