Students sometimes fill out the form with less detail and so they need to be re-filled or the students have to provide more feedback/evidence. This leads to multiple documents being created and a lot of paperwork explaining the scenario. The forms are then accessed and duplicated by other departments and also added to the system for the Student Report. Multiple departments with different hieratic allowances creates a lot of confusion which then leads to improper book keeping and a reduction in information confidentiality. These forms may also be up for appeal and with multiple and mixed up forms the whole process tends to be biased.
