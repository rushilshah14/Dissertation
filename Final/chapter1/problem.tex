Students sometimes fill out the form with less detail, and so they need to be re-filled, or the students have to provide more feedback/evidence. This leads to multiple documents being created and much paperwork explaining the scenario. The forms are then accessed and duplicated by other departments and also added to the system for the Student Report. Various departments with different hieratic allowances create much confusion which then leads to improper bookkeeping and a reduction in information confidentiality. These forms may also be up for appeal, and with multiple and mixed up forms the whole process tends to be biased.
