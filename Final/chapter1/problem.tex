Students sometimes fill out the form with less detail or require more proof, and so they need to be re-filled or additional proof needs to be uploaded. The data from the form is simplified and confidential data is removed after which it is made available to the staff members and relevant departments. The simplified version of the form is also exported into the Student's portfolio. Various departments with different hieratic allowances creates a lot of confusion which then leads to improper bookkeeping and a reduction in information confidentiality. These forms may also be up for appeal, and with multiple and mixed up forms the whole process tends to be biased and loss of data is inevitable.
