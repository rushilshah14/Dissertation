Students who suffer from problems fill out the Extenuating Circumstances Form (ECF) which then allows the scrutiny committee to consider their problems. The process usually begins
with the student submitting the form which then gets reviewed. In situations where there is not enough evidence, the committee asks the student to provide more evidence and then processes the information accordingly; for example, the committee may ask the student to present a death certificate. The form, at this point, has detailed information about the personal problem, but from here on only the general problem (without including details of the specific problem the student is facing) is taken ahead to the other departments and also added to the Students Record to allow leniency in terms of examinations and other assignments. Information regarding the ECF's can be found on the University
Of Sheffield's page.\cite{ecfuni}
