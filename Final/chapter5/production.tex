The implementation process began with re-constructing the HTML template by C Tim\cite{creativeTimTemplate} to the different sections mentioned in chapter 4.2, JavaScript going along with the HTML and finally the Django back-end.

\subsection{HTML}
Redesigning the HTML code required changing the CSS, HTML components as well are removing unwanted JavaScript code. This brought about various bugs and unexpected changes in the overall HTML which crashed a few elements of the code such as Tables. With the use of Google Chrome and Console the debugging was completed and successful HTML pages were created for all three different sections as mentioned in Chapter 4.2. However, since pages are going to be repeated(Dashboard, Viewform, Profile, etc) only one HTML code was required and repeated depending on which panel you are logged in as.
