JavaScript is another important part of the design as it will help manipulate the HTML in order to achieve the requirements for the system. The system will use JavaScript in various different ways. Most of the code will be from readily available packages while a small portion will be coded based on the requirements. To begin with, \textit{Bootstrap 4}\cite{bootstrapfour} will allow the HTML to be accessible on mobile devices as well as make the html elements look smoother. A long with mobile first coding, the HTML tables will need a sorting and searching script which will be provided by \textit{DataTables}\cite{datatables}. One of the requirements is to be able to download and save the data from the forms, in order to do so, the HTML page must be converted to PDF and the use of \textit{jsPDF}\cite{jsPDF} a long with \textit{html2canvas}\cite{htmlcanvas} will be extremely useful. Each of the scripts mentioned above will be further explained under Chapter \ref{ch:implementation} with detail.
