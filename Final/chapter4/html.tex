The HTML template used in the production of this system needed to be able to support the different types of user groups i.e Students, Secretary Panel and Scrutiny Panel. With research a \textit{Public Licensed}\cite{creativeTimTemplateLicense} Bootstrap 4\cite{bootstrapfour} HTML template\cite{creativeTimTemplate} designed with a mobile-first coding aspect by \textit{Creative Tim} will be used as the base of development. The selected template is an "Admin Template" which has functionality built in such as HTML for statistics, graphs and more. Table \ref{tab:panelpages} shows the relevant panel and its pages.
