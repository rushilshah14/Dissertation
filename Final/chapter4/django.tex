Django will run the system as the main back-end code. Its inbuilt functionality allows us to use GET and POST forms as well as uploading and retrieving data directly to the websites HTML pages. Django also allows the use of external packages, All-Auth\cite{allauth} which is a precoded authentication package allowing the use of external accounts such as Google, Dropbox, Github, LinkedIn and many others will be used to allow logging in directly into our system. All-Auth uses sessions to authenticate users into the system and prevent unauthorised logins. It has a \textit{login\_required} function which can be used with individual pages to prevent unauthorised accesses without logging in. \\[4mm]

Bcrypt\cite{bcrypt} is a password hashing function which can be combined with Django and All-Auth to securely store user passwords into the database with a salt hash. Our system will be using a SHA256 BCrypt Hasher which is currently one of the safest password encryptions\cite{bcryptpower}.
