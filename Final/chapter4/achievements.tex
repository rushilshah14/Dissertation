Research between different systems such as Web Based, Smart Phone application, Blockchain and a few others has been completed allowing me to select one from all of them and move it ahead to the development stage in the coming few weeks. Planning for the interface and its functions has also been achieved as seen in chapter 3.3 and having ideas on which possible tests can be done to check the progress of the project in relation to the requirements.
