The current system can be the base for an entirely secure and efficient future system. The following is a list of possible implementations which can be completed by further studies. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use of Django file encryption projects\cite{ruddra}\cite{danielquinn} to create a custom encrypted file upload system which stores the uploaded files with a \textbf{SHA256 encryption} onto the hosting servers folder system. 
  \item Django-pgcrypto\cite{dbencrypt} can be implemented onto the \textbf{PostgreSQL} database server in order to \textbf{encrypt each single entry} into the database which will protect against any unauthorised access directly into the database. This system would work with the current \textit{forms.py} and encrypt data as it is entered into the database. Extremely important for a system like this for additional protection. 
  \item Ability to send students a message directly from the system. A \textbf{messaging system} as such would allow both the secretary and the student to converse within the form which could be extremely useful in case the form needs to be reviewed.
  \item A text area within the form accessible by the secretary and the scrutiny panel to write down the \textbf{minutes of the meeting}. This would be very useful as the minutes can be referred to directly when accessing the form. However, these would be hidden from everyone else including the staff members and the student.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Alternate uses for such a system}
This project has been focused on security, ease of access and the ability to get data off users and accessed by other users. A system like this can be edited into various other branches which involve interaction between two groups of users who require confidentiality and security. Below is a list of possible uses and scenarios where such a system can be highly useful if edited to purpose. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Survey System} - Gathering information with questions being asked in place of the extenuating circumstance form and assessed by the supervisors. Such a system can be edited to simply fill the form and submit without having the user to login or provide personal details. Statistics can be added including graphs to calculate the respective results. 
\item \textbf{Grading System} - Users can upload files and data similarly to the current Extenuating Circumstance Form and it can be assessed by a superior user and graded accordingly. To achieve this the system would need to duplicate the status system(Pending, Approved, Rejected) and allow it to grade based on integers for example; \textit{80/100}.
\item \textbf{Medical Appointments \& Meetings} - The system can be adjusted to allow patients to fill out medical forms directly onto the system which are then assessed and viewed by superiors. A payment system can also be directly added onto the system which allows the patient to have records of their payment and each medical form they have filled or simply to record every meeting occurred between the two. 
\end{itemize}
These are just a few examples of where such a system can be useful. With more encryption as mentioned under Chapter \ref{ch:futurework} this system can be developed into very many different branches of data retrieval.
