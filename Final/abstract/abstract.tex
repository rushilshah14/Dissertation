Students who suffer from personal problems usually fill out the Extenuating Circumstances Form; these forms get processed through different departments, some with higher clearance than others. The secretary and scrutiny committee make decisions based on the forms to approve academical leniency towards the student in question while regular staff members get a sanitised version of the circumstance in order to maintain confidentiality. Sometimes, the student may need to provide additional proof for their circumstance. This project aims to create a web-based secure system with guidance from literature reviews and research. With Django, each of the requirements mentioned above will be satisfied by design production and following it up with implementation. Furthermore, testing and evaluation will allow us to know if we have successfully fulfilled the requirements or discovered unaccounted variables. Additional research and work may be required to obtain a completely secure solution.
