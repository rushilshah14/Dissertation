This chapter will take Django as the main language used for developing the web-based system and present ways in which the project can be compiled. Django provides a platform through which we can create a fully functional web-based design, but within the design, there are alternative ways to go about. Eventually, there will be changes in the implementation, but this chapter will cover the basis of the implementation decisions.
