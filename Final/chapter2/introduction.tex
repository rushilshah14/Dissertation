Digitalising the Extenuating Circumstances Forms would have different platforms to choose from as technology has upgraded significantly over the past decade. Web-based Systems, Smart Phone Applications, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence\cite{forbestop7} and recently introduced Blockchain Technology. However, for a system allowing users to fill forms, it would be challenging to use Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality as these are used for altering the perception of the world\cite{arvr}. Same goes for Artificial Intelligence as this would be costly to implement and not very useful when it comes to Extenuating Circumstances. In this section, we will look at web-based Systems, mobile phone applications and the blockchain technology. Further, we will eliminate mobile applications and blockchain and focus more on the Web Based Systems.
