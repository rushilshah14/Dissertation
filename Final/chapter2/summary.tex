Django, compared to various other web frameworks, is a good environment to use for the Extenuating Circumstance Forms because it provides security we are looking for, avoids vulnerabilities and is really fast when accessing and using with SQLite. Regular updates provided by the developers of Django allow security to be maintained at all times. Even with small or large numbers of data, it will be able to process it really quickly. Upgrading the system at a later stage will also be simple as Python is a highly developed language.
