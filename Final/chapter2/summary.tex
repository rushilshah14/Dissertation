Django, compared to various other web frameworks, is a excellent environment to use for the Extenuating Circumstance Forms because it provides the security we are looking for, avoids vulnerabilities and is fast when accessing and using with SQLite. Regular updates provided by the developers of Django allow security maintenance at all times. Even with small or large numbers of data, it will be able to process it quickly. Upgrading the system at a later stage will also be simple as Python is a highly developed language.
